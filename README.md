# Analysis of Depression as an Outcome of Regional Differences and Educational Disparities

The following describes a project completed for credit in the CUNY School of Professional Studies' DATA 606 course.

Data were sourced from the 2022 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data collected by the CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhis/2022nhis.htm

The goal of this project was to assess the relationships among regional differences (metropolitan-based regions compared to non-metropolitan regions), educational differences (no degree, high school diploma, bachelor's degree, or graduate/post-graduate degree), and mean depression values, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8).
To complete this analysis, a multiple regression analysis was used wherein region and educational attainment acted as predictors and were dummy-coded as a factor variables. Mean depression acted as an outcome variable and was transformed via a Box-Cox transformation in order to account for skewness.

Results indicated that living in non-metropolitan regions was associated with lower mean depression scores. Furthermore, higher levels of education predicted increases in mean depression values. However, an interaction effect among region and depression emerged such that education moderated regional differences. Specifically, having higher levels of deducation seems to be associated with lower depression scores when living in smaller metropolitan regions compared to large metropolitan regions.
